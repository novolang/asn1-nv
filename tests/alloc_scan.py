"""Read the emitted LLVM for asn1-nv's allocation probe and say
whether any function in `asn1tag` can put a cell on the heap.

Run by tests/alloc_scan.sh three times: once on the package as it
stands, and twice on copies with an allocation spliced into the core.
Those two copies are what the scan and the compiler respectively have to
catch, because a check that cannot fail is not a check.

The IR is emitted at `--opt=0` on purpose.  At the default optimisation
level the whole probe inlines into `novo_main`, there is no function
left to attribute an allocation to, and the scan would pass over an
empty file.

# first kind alone would call a per-character boxing loop
